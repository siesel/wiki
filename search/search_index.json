Well those days are kind of back... at least for hams. This is what the kids are calling \"Retro-tech\" today. The Decentralized Amateur Paging Network (DAPNET) is a paging network that was setup by some hams in Germany and has slowly been moving around the world in popularity. While it has a large user base outside the US, it is gaining some traction in the US as well. It utilizes the old POCSAG protocol to send Alpha-Numeric messages to old Alpha-Numeric text pagers. It can breathe new life into those old Alpha-Numberic Pagers that we used to all carry around. It can use your Pi-Star hotspot to send a page or a high profile repeater. More information about DAPNET can be found at https://hampager.de . The site is in German, so you will need to translate it to your language, or be able to read German. The DAPNET Paging Gateway provides the ability to simulate the old paging gateway callback system from HOIP to DAPNET. Questions about the DAPNET Paging Gateway can be directed to Jeff, N8ACL at extension 100070 or on Discord or via email n8acl@qsl.net. Accessing the DAPNET Paging Gateway \u00b6 The DAPNET Paging Gateway is accessible from any of the linked services to HOIP (HOIP, AmateurWire, OARC and Meshphone) using the correct access code from the linked services of course. From West of the Rockies, call extension 90004 From East of the Rockies, call extension 90004 In either case, press 2 at the menu voice prompts. Using the DAPNET Paging Gateway \u00b6 After pressing 2 your call will be directed to the gateway. Dialing a person is accomplished by DMR ID. This was the most universally accessible way to make this work (more on that below, see the FAQ's). Follow the voice prompts given to use the gateway: At the Beep, enter the DMR ID of the person you wish to contact and then press the pound key - At the beep, dial the DMR ID of the person. At the beep, please enter your callback number and then press the pound key. - at the beep, enter the number you want the person to call you back at. This can be your Ham VOIP extension (any of the services) or an actual PSTN number. A page will then be sent to the person and be formatted as Yourcallsign: Call me at YourCallbackNumber #HOIP_DAPNET_GATEWAY Example: N8ACL: Call me at 8675309 #HOIP_DAPNET_GATEWAY At the end, the call will automatically hangup. Thanks \u00b6 I did want to say thanks to the people who, behind the scenes, helped me with research, testing, encouragement and even gave me the idea to do this. You know who you are. Availability \u00b6 The gateway is available subject to all the usual things that effect downtime at a residence. Power, Network, Internet, etc. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) \u00b6 How does this work? \u00b6 There is alot of technical mumbo jumbo I can get into, but simply just know that there is alot of Python and Asterisk Magic going on in the background. There is alot of data being pulled, messaged and loaded from various sources to make it all work. Why DMR ID for dailing a person instead of RIC or HOIP Extension? \u00b6 DMR ID is a universal number that any ham can have. That is why this was chosen. There is not a way to cross reference Pager RICS to Callsigns from DAPNET and not every DAPNET Subscriber will have a HOIP/AW/OARC/MP extension. Plus DAPNET uses a modified version of a persons DMR ID as the Pager RIC, if they do not provide one from the pager they have. So using this method, a user can send a page to any DAPNET Subscriber. The script that is used will convert the DMR ID to a callsign to send the page to them via the DAPNET API. How do I know or how do I find out if the person I want to page is a DAPNET Subscriber? \u00b6 Yeah. This is a tricky question as there really is no straight answer. There are some ways to do this: First off, the easiest way is to ask the person you are wanting to send pages to. If you are a DAPNET Subscriber yourself, you can login to the DAPNET website and do a search for the person. If they come up, they are a subscriber. However, they need to have everything setup and configured for it to go through. Otherwise, there really isn't a straight forward way So how do I find a person's DMR ID? \u00b6 Once you know if a person is a DAPNET subscriber, you can go to RadioID.Net and use the online database search to get their DMR ID. You can also look in the HOIP/AW/OARC phonebook and see if it is there. And of course, you can always ask the person you want to page for their DMR ID. What if they don't have a DMR ID? \u00b6 Then you are not able to use this system to page them. Sorry. There is nothing I can do about that. How do I know if the page went through? \u00b6 Just like in the old days, the only way you know it went through and if they got it is if they call you back. You just have to cross your fingers and hope for the best. What happens if I try to page someone who is not a DAPNET subscriber? \u00b6 Absolutly nothing. No message will go through to anyone. As the old saying goes, it will just drift in CyberSpace for all eternity. Unfortunatly, just like the old days, there will also be no prompt on the phone either. You just have to cross your fingers and hope for the best. What if I want to send a text page to someone? \u00b6 You can use the Discord DAPNET bot in the HOIP Discord Server. Please see https://github.com/n8acl/dapnet_discord_bot#bot-commands or type /help in a HOIP Discord channel and make sure to select the one for the DAPNET Bot on how to make this work (note that you must be a DAPNET subscriber to use this). One other option, if you are a DAPNET Subscriber and have configured Pi-Star to use DAPNET, is to use the API built into Pi-Star. There are other guides online to do that. Another option is to use the DAPNET App that is available on the iOS and Google Play app stores.

That is why this was chosen. There is not a way to cross reference Pager RICS to Callsigns from DAPNET and not every DAPNET Subscriber will have a HOIP/AW/OARC/MP extension. Plus DAPNET uses a modified version of a persons DMR ID as the Pager RIC, if they do not provide one from the pager they have. So using this method, a user can send a page to any DAPNET Subscriber. The script that is used will convert the DMR ID to a callsign to send the page to them via the DAPNET API.","title":"Why DMR ID for dailing a person instead of RIC or HOIP Extension?"},{"location":"General/audio_services/dapnet_gateway/#how-do-i-know-or-how-do-i-find-out-if-the-person-i-want-to-page-is-a-dapnet-subscriber","text":"Yeah. This is a tricky question as there really is no straight answer. There are some ways to do this: First off, the easiest way is to ask the person you are wanting to send pages to. If you are a DAPNET Subscriber yourself, you can login to the DAPNET website and do a search for the person. If they come up, they are a subscriber.

If an answer requires more indepth steps, a guide will be created and linked to from this document. This is a long document, so to the right side of this page is a Table of Contents that will link you to the sections and within each section is a smaller Table of Contents that will link you to the question you have and the answer. You can also do a search by doing Ctrl + F on Windows and Linux or Cmd + F on Mac. General \u00b6 How do I get started? \u00b6 First you will need to get a phone. As long as your phone will allow or handle SIP, you are good to go. Then check out our Getting Started Guide to start the process. You can also look through the rest of the Wiki to get an idea on how to get started. Where can I go for more help? \u00b6 You are already in the best place for getting more help! This Wiki. This is where alot of guides and information can be found about the service and things are added all the time. Next place you can go is one of our Chat Services . Our main form of communication is Discord, but some other chat services are bridged into it. Can I contribute to the Wiki? \u00b6 Absolutely! We encourage our user community to contribute to the Wiki to help expand the knowledge here. To see how, check out our Getting Started Guide What Feature Codes can I use on the system? \u00b6 All Feature Codes can be found in the Feature Codes Guide Troubleshooting \u00b6 The light for my HOIP extension is not green (its orange, amber, yellow) and I have not changed anything on my end. What has happened or what do I do? \u00b6 This is becoming a common issue on the service we are finding. This could be a Carrier Grade NAT situation. We might have to make some adjustments on the peer for your extension. Some steps to take first (in order): Reboot your modem Reboot your router Reboot your phone Double check to make sure none of your configuration has changed (password, domain, etc.) If you are using Hamshack Hotline, please check here to make sure the settings are correct. If these do not fix the issue, you will need to open a ticket to the helpdesk. We will need to make some adjustments. In the ticket, please include the following information: Your name, callsign Your extension Mention the fact that your light is orange Include your IP Address One thing to note here, if you have a Dyanmic DNS Service like DuckDNS or No-IP or similiar, this can be used as well, and is actually prefered. That way we don;t have to keep updating your IP address. Do a search for Dynamic DNS Services online. To get your IP address, please go to https://pb.hamsoverip.com/diy and copy and paste the IP address that is shown there into the ticket. This will allow the admins to make the adjustments needed and then they will get back to you about the fix being implemented. I had to reprovision my phone (with HH) and now HOIP will not work. How do I fix this? \u00b6 Hamshack Hotline provisions certain phones from their servers and take over line 1 of the phone. When a user needs to reprovision since HH does not care if other services could be running on the phone, there are alot of settings problems that are induced to the phone by them, which causes problems for end users. For those of you that have reprovisioned your phone due to Hamshack Hotline or a factory reset and then reprovisioning Hamshack Hotline to fix these issues and be able to use other services: Goto your HOIP extension tab and change TCP to UDP. In the SYSTEM tab, please fill in PRIMARY DNS with 8.8.8.8 SECONDARY DNS to 8.8.4.4 or you can use DNS servers of your choice (for example if you run a DNS source on your home network like Pi-Hole or if you don't want to use the Google servers above). Make sure you have your HOIP extension configured with the proper credentials. Submit changes and reboot. Phones \u00b6 What phones work with HOIP? \u00b6 The nice thing about the Hams Over IP service is we are a BOYD (Bring Your Own Device) service. So any phone that you can configure for SIP connections can be used on the service, on any peer. We have people that use Cisco, Grandstream, Polycomm, Yealink, Fanvil, Softphones and many other types of phones. As long as you can configure the phone to use SIP, you are good to go. How do I configure X phone to work with HOIP? \u00b6 Take a look through the Configuration Guides in the Wiki and see if your phone has a configuration guide. If not, you can ask on any of our chat services to see if someone has configured it. If there is not a configuration guide, you are also welcome to contribute to the Wiki and add a guide for your phone. That would help out others. To see how to contribute, look at the Contributing Guide . I had to reprovision my phone or factory reset my phone and I cannot find/lost my credientals. What do I do? \u00b6 If you can't find your credentials, you can put a ticket into the Helpdesk Ticketing system and request your credentials be resent to you. How do I access my Voicemail? \u00b6 Dial *97 from your phone or hit the voicemail button. This will drop you into your mailbox. If this is the first time accessing your mailbox, the system will walk you through setting up your outgoing voicemail messages and make you change your pin. Once you have all this setup, all you need to do is dial *97 from your phone, or hit the voicemail button and it will just drop you into your box to let you retreive messages. PBXs \u00b6 What PBXs work with HOIP? \u00b6 Good Question. As of right now, we know that FreePBX and 3CX both work with the service. Both can connect via SIP Trunks and FreePBX is able to use IAX. But otherwise, we don't really know of more. If you know of others that use SIP Trunks and can configure them, we would like to know more about it. In fact, if you can create a configuration guide, please submit it. If you want to use FreePBX or 3CX, please check out the configuration guides for each here in the Wiki. How do I configure my PBX to work with HOIP? \u00b6 Good question! If it's one we have a guide for, check out the configuration guides for the PBXs. If it's one that we don't have a guide for, please write one up and submit it. Website/Ticket System \u00b6 I am a new user and just created an account in OS Ticket, but I am not able to log in. \u00b6 Chances are pretty good the verification email from the system was sent to your spam folder. There are some email providers that either block or mark the emails as spam. Check your spam folder. If it's not there, it might have been blocked. Reach out to an admin on Discord and see if they can activate your account. Once that is done, you should be able to log in and see your tickets. I put a ticket in to get a new extension, but I have not gotten my credentials email? \u00b6 This could be a couple of things: Remember we are all volunteers. We try to get to tickets as quick as we can, but we also have lives outside of this project. So it could take a day or two before we can get to the ticket Possibly the same reason as above. Your email provider spam foldered it or blocked it. Again, reach out to an admin on Discord and they can DM you your credentials.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"General/user_guides/faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Last Updated: 08/16/2022 This document is a place to put some of the more Frequently Asked Questions of the service that are quick, short answers.

We are happy to have you here! There are other Ham Radio VOIP Services out there, but we are glad you chose to get an extension with us. One of the nice things about this system is it is a \"Bring Your Own Device\" kind of thing. We will give you your credentials and allow you to configure your phone yourself. We also allow up to 10 endpoints (different phones) on your account. Because we put the onus of phone configuration back on the user, you will need to be familiar with configuring your device. Please note that you MUST have an extension on the system before you can request and be approved for a conference bridge, a RF Link extension or an audio services extension. So lets get started: First, you will need to enter a ticket in our ticketing system. Please go to https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/osticket/ and create an account. Once your account is created, you will get a verification email to the email address you used to signup with. If you do not have the email within a few minutes, you will need to check your Spam or Junk folders, in case it got routed there by your email provider. Once you have verified your email, you will need to log into the Ticketing System and then request a new extension. Follow the prompts on the screen to do that. After your request is in, it can take a bit before your line is provisioned. Please be patient. Once your extension is provisioned, you will get sent an email with your credentials. When configuration screens ask for a user name, your user name is your extension number. You can use whatever device you want, but you will need to know how to configure it. Also know that we can support alot of phones, but there are a few that we receommend to make helping the end user easier. However, by joining one of our chat services , you may be able to find help on phones too. While waiting for your line to be provisioned, read through the rest of the Wiki here.

This phone is fully featured and includes all standard telephony features including call forwarding, redial, speed dial, do not disturb and voicemail. Calls can be made using the handset, the speak or a headset. This phone also has the ability to connect one attendant console to it to expand the number of speed dial lines that the phone can use. To power this phone, you will either need a POE Switch or a POE injector. This phone also provides a web based interface to configure the features of the phone. Obtain the IP Address of the Phone \u00b6 After connecting the phone to the network and letting it boot, you can then obtain the IP Address of the phone. Press the Setup button. This button looks like a piece of paper with the upper right corner of the paper folded down. You can then scroll down to the Network option or hit the number 9 Button. Hit Select Option 2 should show the IP address of the phone. Note this down as you will need it to configure the phone. Log into the Web Interface \u00b6 Open a web browser on another computer that is also on the same network as the phone Put the IP address you obtained above into the address bar Once the webpage comes up, in the upper right hand corner click Admin Login and then Advanced . This will bring up all the options for the phone. You should see a number of tabs across the screen. Set a Static IP Address \u00b6 You should set a static IP address for the phone. This makes accessing the Web Interface easier and helps the phone connect through the router a little easier. Click on the System tab Find and set the following fields on that tab. Connection Type : Static IP Static IP : You can either set this to the IP Address you obtained above, or if you use specific IP scheme on your network, you can set it to that. Gateway : This is the IP address of your Router, the one you use to log into the web interface of your router. Primary DNS : 8.8.8.8 Leave everything else at default and hit the Submit All Changes button at the bottom of the screen. At this point your phone will reboot. Once this is done, log back into the Web interface using the IP address we just set as static and make sure you are logged in as admin and in the advanced features mode. Set the Line Keys (Only needed after factory reset) \u00b6 If you have to factory reset the phone, by default, the phone will have Extension 1 set for all 4 line keys for the phone. We will need to fix this so that each of the line keys is it's own extension. Otherwise each line will function like line 1. There is no need to repeat the line. Click the Phone tab Scroll to Line Key 2 and set the extension to number 2 Scroll to Line Key 3 and set the extension to number 3 Scroll to Line Key 4 and set the extension to number 4 Leave everything else at Default and click Submit All Changes at the bottom. The phone will reboot. Once this is done, log back into the Web interface and make sure you are logged in as admin and in the advanced features mode. Configure your Extension for HOIP \u00b6 Now we can finally configure your extension for HOIP. Click on the Extension tab you want to use. For example, if this is the only or the first account on the phone, click on the Ext 1 tab. Otherwise if Extension 1 is being used, select the tab for the next free extension. Find and set the following fields on this tab: Line Enabled : yes NAT Keep alive Enable : yes NAT Mapping Enable : yes SIP Transport : UDP Proxy : the domain and port of the server from your credentials email Example: pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com:5160 Register Expires : 3600 Display Name : This can be what you want to call it. This sets the display name for the line key on your phone screen. Suggested it would be your extension on HOIP from the credential email. User ID : This is the extension number from the credentials email. Password : The password from the credentials email. Leave everything else at default and click Submit All Changes at the bottom. The phone will reboot. Once it comes back up, the line you just configured should show green, showing that it is connected to the server. When you pick up the handset you should have a dial tone. Make a test call \u00b6 Now we need to make a test call to make sure things are working. You can dial 3192 (Talking Clock) to test your connection. To make a call, you can do this a couple of different ways: Pick up the handset, Hit the speaker button or press the line key. This will give you a dial tone. Dial the number you want to call. Just start dialing the number you wish to call and then do one of the above to start the phone dialing automatically. Setup the Voicemail Button \u00b6 The 504G has a button on the phone that will automatically dial your voicemail. To configure this function Log into the web interface and click on the Phone tab. Find the field called Voice Mail Number Set this to *97 Click Submit All Changes at the bottom. The phone will reboot. Once it comes back up, pick up your handset, making sure to select the line for your HOIP Extension and hit the Voicemail button on the phone. It should dial into your HOIP voicemail If you have other services on the phone, this configuration will also allow you to dial your voicemail on those services. Set the Date and Time Automatically \u00b6 The phone will display the current date and time on the display in a bar at the top. This can be set to stay in sync automatically with the correct time and not have to set a Daylight Saving Time rule or manually set the date or time all the time (the clock can drift a little over time). To configure this: Click on the System Tab Find and set the following fields NTP Enable : yes Primary NTP Server : pool.ntp.org Click on the Regional Tab Find and set the following fields: Time Zone : Set to your time zone offset (Example: US Eastern Time is GMT-04:00 ) Daylight Saving Time Enable : yes Click Submit All Changes at the bottom. The phone will reboot. Once it comes back up, verify that the time is set properly. It should now update automatically with Daylight Saving Time and also stay in sync and the time should not drift on the display. Tips and Tricks \u00b6 Here are some other fun Tips and Tricks you can do with the phone: If you go to the Phone tab and find the field marked Station Display Name you can set this field to display some text in the top most bar of the display on the phone where the clock is at. After setting this, click Submit All Changes at the bottom and let the phone reboot. For example, I (Jeff, N8ACL) set mine to Jeff, N8ACL and now that displays in that bar. The phone has the capability to display a small BMP logo on the main part of the screen or it can display some text. I (Jeff, N8ACL) like to have it show text. To configure this: Click on the Phone tab. Find the following fields and set them: Text Logo : You can set this to whatever text you want displayed. For my phone, I (Jeff, N8ACL) set it as Jeff, N8ACL Select Background Picture : Set this to Text Logo After making any of the changes above, click Submit All Changes and let the phone reboot. Once it comes back up, verify that the changes you made are showing on the phone.

This allows you to use any number of phones on your extension, control your own voicemail and many other things. In many ways, it's easier to run your own PBX then it is to try to connect multiple phones to our system. The more people who can use a their own PBX is the less number of phones trying to register to our network and helps keep resources free. 3CX is only a SIP based PBX. Therefore, when requesting a new line for use with 3CX, you will just need to request a new extension. DO NOT REQUEST A TRUNK. If you request a trunk, it will be configured for an IAX connection for Asterisk/FreePBX. We do not want that. Also, if you already have an extension on the HOIP Network, you do not need to have it converted or anything. All you would be doing is replacing your existing endpoint with 3CX and then connecting to that your existing endpoint to your new PBX. You don't have to configure Voicemail on 3CX if you do not want to and continue to use your existing voicemail box provided on the HOIP Network. If you want to use voicemail on the 3CX PBX, see the note at the end of this document on steps to take. It does take a bit of work to get your own PBX configured and setup, but it in the end, the rewards are nice. This guide assumes that you already have a 3CX PBX setup and ready and have also setup user extensions and voicemail boxes. There are many other guides on the Internet explaining how to do this, so that is outside the scope of this document. Configuring the Trunk \u00b6 Create the Trunk \u00b6 Log into your 3CX PBX Management Console. Click on SIP Trunks in the left hand column. Click Add SIP Trunk . Select Generic in the Select Country dropdown. Then select Asterisk in the Select Provider in your Country dropdown. Enter the extension number/Username that you received in the email from the HOIP System in the Main Trunk No field. Click Ok . This should drop you into the edit screen for the trunk. Now give it a name in the Enter name for Trunk field (Suggested \"HOIP\") In the Registrar/Server/Gateway Hostname or IP field, enter the FQDN of of the PBX Server your extension is on. This will be in the email from the HOIP system. You will only need to put the FQDN in the first box. In the box at the end of that line, you will need to put the port in (5160). Example FQDN: pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com Scroll down to the Authentication section In the Type of Authentication drop down select Register/Account based Put the extension (username) in the Authentication ID (aka SIP User ID) field. Again, this is from the email that you received from the HOIP System. Put the password from the email in the Authentication Password field. Leave the rest as default. Click OK at the top to save the settings. Wait a minute or two for the trunk to register. It should register, unless you entered something wrong. If it does not register, go back and check all your settings. Configure 3CX Outbound Rule \u00b6 Once we have the Trunk setup and registered correctly, now we need an outbound route. This is so you can make calls out of your PBX. Click on Outbound Rules on the left hand menu. Click Add . Give it a name in Rule Name (Suggested: \"HOIP Outbound\") In the Calls to numbers starting with prefix give it a prefix for dialing. This would be a number that the PBX would see at the beginning of the dialed number that it would know to use this new route. I used 8 for mine. If you know of or remember the old \"Dial 9 for an outside line\" thing in offices, this is the same thing. This way you don't accidently dial out of your HOIP trunk if you are trying to make a different call. Scroll Down to the Make outbound calls on Section. For Route 1 select the HOIP Trunk we configured above. In the Strip Digits dropdown, choose the number 1. This will strip off the prefix we defined above and then send the rest of the number dialed down the \"trunk\". Click OK at the top to save your settings. Now whenever you want to dial someone on HOIP, you will dial 8+<The Extension> (example: 8100070 for N8ACL). Any other house type calls will not go out this trunk. If you use this for a home PBX, you will need to make sure to dial 1-800 or 1-855 to make toll free calls on your home number, depending on the number you use for the prefix. Configure 3CX Inbound Rule \u00b6 Once we have the Trunk setup and registered correctly, now we need an outbound route. Click on Inbound Rules on the left hand menu. Click Add DID Rule . Give it a name in Name (Suggested: \"HOIP Inbound\") In the DID/DDI give it your extension number on HOIP. In the Route calls to Section, this is where you set the routing for the incoming calls for HOIP. You can route both (internal and external) to a specific extension or to a ring group if you have one setup. You could also route the calls to a voicemail box directly if you wanted to. Click OK at the top to save your settings. Now Test \u00b6 Now pickup a phone and call an extension on HOIP to test it and also see if you can have someone call you. Everything should flow correctly. Voicemail Options \u00b6 The nice thing about 3CX is you can have the PBX handle your voicemail, or you can have HOIP handle the voicemail. If you want HOIP to handle voicemail, just disable the voicemail options for the extension that incoming HOIP calls are being routed to on 3CX. If you want to handle voicemail your self, you have two additional options for this: You can have your HOIP Voicemail box disabled and have everything roll to your PBX You can set your pickup time on voicemail to 10 seconds on your 3CX PBX voicemail. This will pickup your call and send it to voicemail before HOIP. This option allows you to keep your HOIP Voicemail Box as a backup in case your PBX goes off line for some reason, allowing you to continue to get voicemails to your extension.

You want to offer some audio services or other services on the same extension as your regular phone. You find out how much cooler it is to run a SIP trunk vs an IAX Trunk.

Configuring the Trunk \u00b6 Create the Trunk \u00b6 Log into your PBX admin screen Click Conectivity and then Trunks Click Add Trunk on the next screen and then select Add SIP (chan_pjsip) Trunk in the drop down. You should now be in the Add Trunk screen. Fill in the fields as such: Trunk Name - Name of the Trunk. Suggested: HOIP Hide CallerID - Make sure this is set to No . Outbound CallerID - Your actual extension. This would be the extension for the Trunk that was sent to you in the email. CID Options - Make sure this is set for Allow Any CID . Disable Trunk - Make sure this is set for No . Leave the Defaults for everything else. Next Click the pjsip Settings tab. On that screen edit the following: On the General Tab: Username - This is your extension number from the email. Auth username - This is your extension number from the email. secret - This is the password of your extension from the email. SIP Server - this is the domain of the PBX server from your email. ex. pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com SIP Server Port - This is the port of the PBX server from your email. Typically this will always be 5160 . Leave all other defaults Once that is filled out go to the Advanced tab and find the following fields: Contact User - This will be your extension from the email. From User - This will also be your extension from the email. Click Submit and then Apply Changes at the top right. Create Outbound Route \u00b6 Once you have the trunk created, you will need to configure an Outgoing Route in order to make outgoing calls on your trunk. Click Conectivity and then Outbound Routes Click Add Route . You should now be in the Edit Route Screen. You will need to fill in the fields as follows: Route Name - This is the name you want to call your outgoing route. Suggested: HOIP Skip down to Trunk Sequence for Matched Routes and select the HOIP Trunk you created earlier. Click Submit and then Click the red Apply Changes in the upper right corner of the screen. As long as this is the only route/trunk on your PBX system, you are good to move on. Otherwise, if this is not the only trunk on your system, you may want to setup a prefix to dial to get this trunk. (Very Similiar to the old \"Dial 9 to get an outside line\" thing back in the day.) If you want to set this up, click the Dial Patterns tab and then add a number for the prefix to dial, usually a single digit, in the prefix field for one of the dial patterns. Then add a . in the match pattern field next to it. Then Submit and Apply Changes . Now to select that line, all you need to do is dial the prefix and then the number you want to call. Otherwise, if you do not set this up, all you will need to do is dial the HOIP number you want to call. Create Inbound Route \u00b6 Now you will need to create an Inbound Route in order to receive calls on your phone. In order to do this: Click Conectivity and then Inbound Routes Click Add Route . You should now be in the Edit Route Screen. You will need to fill in the fields as follows: Description - This is the name of the Route. Suggested - HOIP Set Destination - This is where you want the incoming call to go to. This can be set to anywhere you want to send the call, for example, a specific extension, a ring group, a specific voicemail box, an IVR or even to a Time Condition. Click Submit and then Click the red Apply Changes in the upper right corner of the screen. You should now be able to make and receive calls across your HOIP Trunk. Voicemail Options \u00b6 The nice thing about FreePBX is you can have the PBX handle your voicemail, or you can have HOIP handle the voicemail. If you want HOIP to handle voicemail, just disable the voicemail options for the extension that incoming HOIP calls are being routed to on your FreePBX. If you want to handle voicemail your self, you have two additional options for this: You can have your HOIP Voicemail box disabled and have everything roll to your PBX You can set your pickup time on voicemail to 10 seconds on your FreePBX voicemail. This will pickup your call and send it to voicemail before HOIP. This option allows you to keep your HOIP Voicemail Box as a backup in case your PBX goes off line for some reason, allowing you to continue to get voicemails to your extension. To do this in FreePBX: Click on Settings at the top of the screen. This should put you into the FreePBX Advanced Settings screen. Scroll down and find the Ringtime Default . The default setting is 15 seconds. Set this to 10. This will allow your extension to ring for 10 seconds and then your voicemail will pick up before the HOIP one does. If your PBX goes offline, the call will roll over to the HOIP voicemail system instead. Then Submit and Apply Changes .

DO NOT request a trunk. This will get you setup an IAX Trunk and that will not work with this method. The Ham's Over IP service offers the ability to connect your home FreePBX PBX System to our system. This allows you to use any number of phones on your extension, control your own voicemail and many other things. In many ways, it's easier to run your own PBX then it is to try to connect multiple phones to our system. The more people who can use a their own PBX is the less number of phones trying to register to our network and helps keep resources free. It does take a bit of work to get your own PBX configured and setup, but it in the end, the rewards are nice. This guide assumes that you already have a FreePBX setup and ready. There are many other guides on the Internet explaining how to do this, so that is outside the scope of this document. If you already have an extension on the HOIP Network, you do not need to have it converted or anything. All you would be doing is replacing your existing endpoint with FreePBX and then connecting to that your existing endpoint to your new PBX. You don't have to configure Voicemail on FreePBX if you do not want to and continue to use your existing voicemail box provided on the HOIP Network. If you want to use voicemail on your FreePBX, see the note at the end of this document on steps to take. Why would you want to configure a SIP trunk over an IAX trunk? Let's take a look at a couple scenarios: You started out as just a phone and had it connected to HOIP via SIP, but decided you wanted a little more freedom by running your own PBX. You want to offer some audio services or other services on the same extension as your regular phone. You find out how much cooler it is to run a SIP trunk vs an IAX Trunk.

They do provide their own IM/calling service, but this is not required to make this application work. This client is able to connect directly to a SIP provider without a Jami Login. The client is designed as an IM client for business first with calling capablity added later. This will be something to keep in mind when using the client. As such, there is no actual keypad on the screen at first. Once a call is established, there is the option to open a keypad for entering DTMF commands for Voicemail and other things. There is not a way to add contacts to the application either. The client is available for all major desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS and Linux) as well as all iOS and Android. (Note that for MacOS, it is also available in the MacOS App Store in addition to being a direct download.) Each Platform requires slightly different ways to set up, but for the most part, all the things you will need to change will be pretty easy to find and configure. Jami is available for download from: https://jami.net/download/ Configure for Desktop Platform. \u00b6 Note: You do not need to setup a Jami account for this to work. DO NOT USE THAT METHOD. This Client will connect directly to a SIP provider. First you will need to download and install the client to your desktop platform (How that is done varies from platform to platform and is outside the scope of this document). Once it is installed, open the application. When the initial screen comes up asking if you want to Join Jami or I already have an Existing Account don't choose either. Look for the option marked Advanced Features and click that and then click the option that says Configure a SIP Account . Enter the information for the fields on the next screen (the configuration screen is a bit wonky, but the fields listed below are the fields as they appear. Make sure to select the correct fields to put information into): Server : This will be the domain name and port sent in your credentials email (ex: pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com:5160 ) Proxy : LEAVE THIS BLANK Username : This is your extension sent in your credentials email. Password : This is your password sent in your credentials email. Click Add SIP Account You're done. You should have a little circle icon in the upper left with a green dot on it. This indicates the account is connected. Making and Receiving Calls \u00b6 This is where the app is a little lacking, but for a quick easy SIP client, this is still ok. Remember that this client was designed as an IM client first, with the ability to make and receive calls. Making a Call To make a call, you will need to click on the field marked Find a User or search for a conversation and then type in the extension you want to call and then click on it in the search results. Once this has been done, to the right an IM window will appear and in the top right hand corner, you will see what looks like the handset for a phone. Click that. The Client will start dialing. Once the call has been connected, you will be able to click on a keypad icon in the Ongoing Call window and bring it up. This will allow you to enter commands. Receiving a Call When a call comes into the extension, you will be presented with a screen that will allow you to accept or decline the call. Configure for Mobile Platform \u00b6 Unfortuantely, it is not as easy to configure this for mobile and there are a couple of hoops you need to jump through. After installing the app from the appropriate app store, open the app. You will be presented with a new account screen. Unfortuantly, you will need to create a Jami account for this part, however, it is only nessesary to be able to setup the app at first and then add a SIP account. Tap on Create Jami Account On the next screen, deselect the Register Username switch. This will cause the app to create an anonymous username. Leave everything else alone on this screen. Tap Create Jami Account On the next screen, tap the screen once and then next, leaving the Display name and Avatar blank. At this point you will now be on the main screen, just like on the Desktop Application. It is here we can now add a SIP account. Tap where the random numbers and letters are at the top of the screen. You should get a slide up with the option to Add Account . Tap that. Here you should see the same screen that you saw at first, but it will now have the option to Create a SIP Account . Tap that. Fill in the fields as below: Enter Username : This is your extension from the credentials email Enter Password : This is the password from the credentials email Enter Address : This will be the domain name sent in your credentials email (ex: pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com ) Enter Port : This will be 5160 Tap Create SIP Account It will again ask you to choose a Display Name and Avatar. This does not effect the outbound calls, so you can skip this by tapping the screen and then clicking Next You are finally dropped into the application. Making and Receiving Calls \u00b6 Unlike the desktop app, once you are in the main part of the app, there is a button that will allow you to place calls just like other SIP Clients. Making a Call To make a call, just tap the dialpad button and then dial the number like normal. Receiving a Call When a call comes into the extension, you will be presented with a screen that will allow you to accept or decline the call. Troubleshooting \u00b6 If the mobile app says registration failed or the green check mark is not on the desktop app, this indicates that the account is not registered on the server. Try turning off your home wifi on your phone and letting it connect via cellular. If it connects, it's an issue with your home wifi. If it does not register, it is a configuration error.

If the line is busy, in other words, someone is using the line, it will glow red, otherwise it will glow green. This works for normal extensions and conference bridges as well as the RF-Links Extensions. If someone is dialed into a conference, the light will be red, indicating someone is in the conference, otherwise it will glow green. This Guide describes how to configure the feature on Cisco Phones and Cisco Sidecars. Other phones will probably have a different function string to make this work. In order to do this, you will need to access the Web Configuration of the phone. How this is done varies from phone model to phone model, but for most, if you open a web browser and go to the IP address of the phone, you should be able to access the Web Configuration Interface. From there, you will need to navigate to the extension you want to edit, be it a button on the phone or on the sidecar. When you are at the extension you want to edit, you will need to look for the Extended Function Field for that line and in that you will place something similiar to the following: fnc = sd+blf ; ext = <extension to Monitor>@ $PROXY ; nme = <Friendly Name> ; Where: fnc=sd+blf; - This sets the function of the button for both a speedial and BLF for that button ext=<extension to monitor>@$PROXY; - This is the extension you want to Speedial/monitor. $PROXY is a variable that is taken from another part of the phone configuration. Leave that alone. That just basically sets the server. name=<Friendly Name>; This sets the name of the button that is displayed on the phone screen or the sidecar screen (if it has one). If you are using a sidecar without a screen, this can be omitted for that. OPTIONAL: if you are using a sidecar, you can add vid=N where N is the number of the line you want to send the call out. In other words, let's say you have a Home VOIP number on line 1 and HOIP on line 2 and you want this button to speedial an extension on HOIP, you would set it to look like vid=2 . Otherwise it will default to line 1 of the phone.

If the line is busy, in other words, someone is using the line, it will glow red, otherwise it will glow green. This works for normal extensions and conference bridges as well as the RF-Links Extensions. If someone is dialed into a conference, the light will be red, indicating someone is in the conference, otherwise it will glow green. This Guide describes how to configure the feature on Cisco Phones and Cisco Sidecars. Other phones will probably have a different function string to make this work. In order to do this, you will need to access the Web Configuration of the phone. How this is done varies from phone model to phone model, but for most, if you open a web browser and go to the IP address of the phone, you should be able to access the Web Configuration Interface.

Note that this does not enable Autopatch from the RF connection. This is a one way connection from HOIP to your RF system, basically a reverse autopatch if you will. All RF-Link Extensions will be in the format of 15XXX , 25XXX or 35000 . Creating an RF Connection \u00b6 To create a connection , you first need to have a properly configured AllStar Node. Asterisk is needed to connect to the HOIP system as the HOIP system is based on Asterisk (FreePBX is the GUI front End to Asterisk) as well. There is plenty of documentation online on configuring an Allstar Node, so that is outside the scope of this document. It is recommended, but not required, that you configure a private node on your AllStar Node when configuring the node to have the phone connection tie to. This will allow you to disconnect the phone connection from your AllStar node in case there is a problem. Also, we ask that you check to make sure your PTT command is setup to be *99 and release to be # in your rpt.conf file if you do not already have this setup. This will make sure that once someone dials in that they do not cause interference or problems on accident. This will also make all PTT commands uniform for the system. This should be already set by default, but if you made changes at some point, this may have been changed. On your Allstar Node \u00b6 You will need to edit the IAX.conf and extensions.conf files. In your iax.conf you will need to configure a stanza similar to this: [stanza-must-match-username] username=<username-must-match-stanza> type=user context=hoipphone host=dynamic auth=md5 secret=<choose a password> disallow=all allow=ulaw allow=g726aal2 allow=gsm codecpriority=host transfer=no requirecalltoken=no In your extensions.conf you need to configure a stanza similar to below. * Note : you need to change the node numbers shown below to the node that you are having the connection dial into. So, if you configured a private node and if, for example, that node number is 1999, then you would use 1999 in place of 47374 below: [hoipphone] exten => 47374,1,answer() exten => 47374,n,Playback(rpt/node) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/4) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/7) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/3) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/7) exten => 47374,n,Playback(digits/4) exten => 47374,n,Playback(rpt/connected) exten => 47374,n,Set(CALLSIGN=HOIP-${CALLERID(name)}) exten => 47374,n,rpt(47374|P|${CALLSIGN}) exten => 47374,n,rpt,47374|P Please be sure you have an FQDN for your network.

Make sure to modify this example IAX Dial String to match your system correctly. The IAX2 Dial String is formatted like this: IAX2/username:password@fqdn:port/node-number So for an example: IAX2/username:password@fqdn:4569/1999 This is the most important part. Without this, we are not able to connect to your system. Finally fill out the rest of the requested information in the RF-Link Request area.

Sometimes it takes a village to share the wealth of knowledge out there. This guide will provide methods to make submissions to the wiki as well as the process to expect when a submission is made. Goals \u00b6 Remember, there are some things that you need to keep in mind when submitting new things or changes to the wiki: The directions must be clear and concise. It must be able to be replicated by someone else. Someone should be able to take your document and starting at the top, they should be able to move step by step through it and at the end have the same thing setup as you have. Don't be discouraged if your changes or new item is rejected. It just didn't fit what we needed at the time. If it was rejected, you will be told why and what needs to be done to fix it for it to be included. Methods to Contribute \u00b6 GitHub Pull Request \u00b6 If you are familiar with how Git and Github works, or you have used Github before, you can fork and clone the wiki repo https://github.com/hamsoverip/wiki , make a change and do a pull request to submit it back. Once the PR has been reviewed and merged, the change will be deployed to the wiki site automatically. That is all you need to do if you are submitting that way. This is good for both new items and change requests. If you have forked and cloned a previous version of the repo, PLEASE make sure that you merge any outstanding commits from the main repo to your fork and then do a git pull prior to doing any local editing. This wiki is always in flux and if you do not merge those commits and then do a pull prior to starting editing, you will either miss updates or overwrite things on the repo. It is always good practice to do a merge and a pull prior to starting work on a forked repo anyway. This makes sure you are on the most current main branch edits. Non-Github related way \u00b6 If you are not familiar with Github, or do not have an account, that is ok. You can still contribute. If this is just a change request (in other words something needs to be changed or updated on the wiki), please submit it in the Wiki Chat channel on Discord. No need to format it or anything. This would be things like \"This word is mis-spelled\" or \"can you add this?\" if it is longer, like a rework of an existing document, then please put it into a Markdown Document to make updating easier. If this is a whole new item, it is asked that you make the submission using a Markdown Document. If you are not familiar with Markdown, it is a very simple way to format text files. In fact, this wiki is actually done in Markdown. Markdown makes documentation much easier as it is easier to format commands and such in a way that is familiar. A Markdown Primer can be found here . Submission \u00b6 If you are not using Github to do a pull request, to submit the file, please upload the file to the Wiki Chat channel on Discord. The person in charge of the Wiki will take it and review it. Approval Process \u00b6 Once the change has been submitted, the document will be reviewed. If more clarification is needed, changes will be asked for and the updated file resubmitted. Once everything is in order, the change will be approved and the submission included in the wiki. This process is in place to make sure we have very good and complete documentation on things. It does no good to have a wiki and have things that do not work. But at the same time, if you want to make a submission, be thorough. Go through the process of creating the documentation. Tips for Submission \u00b6 Look though the Markdown Primer linked above. Look at the Github repo (it's a public repo) for the HOIP Wiki to use documents as examples of how to proceed and how to structure your document https://github.com/hamsoverip/wiki . If you have questions, ask. That is what the Wiki Chat is for in Discord. Or reach out to Jeff, N8ACL on Discord directly (@Ravendos#7364). Please do not submit anything other then a Markdown Document. This will get your submission rejected right off the bat till it is in the correct format. Tips and Tricks Learned about MKDocs \u00b6 Typically in Markdown, you only need to indent 2 spaces for nested lists. Apparently in MKDocs, you need to indent 4 Spaces. The upstream provider for the Markdown Plugin for MKDocs has decided to die on a hill and say this is not a bug, which sadly it is. So when doing nested lists (sub points in a list) make sure to indent them 4 spaces.

Objectives of This Wiki \u00b6 In order to contribute to the wiki, you need to understand what the wiki is and the objective behind the wiki. What we are trying to do We are trying to create a series of documents describing the system and its functions. A place where people can go to get answers for questions about the system. Create a set of tools and guides for people to be able to operate on the system. A place to reference advanced techniques on interacting with the system. What we are not trying to do We are not looking to include all steps and references for everything For example, while we provide the ability to connect an Allstar Node to the system, we are not going to include how to setup an Allstar Node from scratch. There are plenty of other guides on the internet on how to do that. We are not trying to be the end all and be all for other VOIP system support.
